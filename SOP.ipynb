    "Model evaluation is a crucial step in the machine learning pipeline that occurs after the model has been trained. It involves assessing the model's performance using various metrics to determine how well it generalizes to unseen data. This evaluation helps identify any potential issues, such as overfitting or underfitting, and guides further improvements to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common evaluation metrics include:\n",
    "- **Accuracy**: The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances. It is a straightforward metric but can be misleading in imbalanced datasets.\n",
